/*
Download the JAR file for OpenCSV from http://opencsv.sourceforge.net. Write
a class with a main method that reads a CSV file of your choice and prints
some of the content. There is sample code on the OpenCSV website. You
havenâ€™t yet learned to deal with exceptions. Just use the following header
for the main method:
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
The point of this exercise is not to do anything useful with CSV files, but
to practice using a library that is delivered as a JAR file
